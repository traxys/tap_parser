# TAP Parser

This library implements a parser for the [Test Anything Protocol](https://testanything.org/).

It implements only the TAP version 14. It should implement all features, including subtests.
Pragmas are ignored.

There are two examples in the `examples`, `json` outputs the TAP document as json, and `parse` outputs a debug representation.
